Stalkerazzi
===========

Wouldn't it be nice to track statistics or auditable events all over your app within the current request context. What if there was a agnostic store so you can switch between logging and active record and mongodb if you get saucy.

A little bit of audit trail, a whole lot of event tracking and too much analytics hindsight = stalkerazzi.

Get all big brother on your users and stalkerize!
