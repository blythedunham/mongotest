# Mongolytics

## Description

Simple analytics tracking for Rails using the awesomest: MongoDB

## Dependencies

    Rails
    MongoDB
    MongoMapper

## Installation

    sudo gem install mongolytics

## Setup

  Just be sure to setup MongoMapper to connect to MongoDB in environment.rb:
  
    Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
      config.gem 'mongomapper', :version => '>= 0.2.1'
    end
    
    MongoMapper.database = "databasename-#{Rails.env}"

## Usage

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      include Mongolytics::Tracker
    end

  In your controllers call any of these (creates an after_filter):

    track_all_stats                               # tracks all actions
    track_view_stats                              # tracks index, show
    track_change_stats                            # tracks create, update, destroy
    track_stats_for :new, :edit, :show, :destroy  # track any action mix, other actions

  If you want to track a session variable:

    track_session_key :username           # tracks session[:username] as a String
    track_session_key :user_id, Integer   # tracks session[:user_id] as an Integer

  If you want to track a params variable:

    track_params_key :username            # tracks params[:username] as a String
    track_params_key :user_id, Integer    # tracks params[:user_id] as an Integer

  Later, retrieve stats via (given UsersController is our controller):

    # by path, useful for getting per-id stats e.g., /users/1
    Mongolytics.stats_for_path user_path(@user)               # using the path helper (not url helper)
    
    # by controller and action keys, useful if you want all views of users/show page
    Mongolytics.stats_for_keys :users, :show                  # using the controller and action

  You can always query the Statistics:

    Mongolytics::Statistic.count(:session => {:user_id => 1})
    Mongolytics::Statistic.count(:param => {:user_id => 1})

## Motivation

### Why use MongoDB?

  It's cool, I wanted to learn it, it's unbelievably fast, and they're working
  on a restful API which might do cool things (pooled analytics tracking)

### This is lame!

  I know I'm only taking hit counts, and not really doing much to track unique
  views, or user tracking, or determining user environments. The reason being:
  that's not what I wanted to do!

  If you want that stuff, and great reporting, and cool graphs: use Google Analytics.
  It's perfect for that stuff! I just wanted counts on certain pages that weren't
  trackable by GA because of their lack of unique url, or view (e.g., create/update/destroy).
