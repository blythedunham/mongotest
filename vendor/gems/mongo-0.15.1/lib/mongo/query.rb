module Mongo

  # A query against a collection. A query's selector is a hash. See the
  # Mongo documentation for query details.
  class Query

    attr_accessor :number_to_skip, :number_to_return, :order_by, :snapshot
    # If true, $explain will be set in QueryMessage that uses this query.
    attr_accessor :explain
    # Either +nil+ or a hash (preferably an OrderedHash).
    attr_accessor :hint
    attr_reader :selector   # writer defined below

    # sel :: A hash describing the query. See the Mongo docs for details.
    #
    # return_fields :: If not +nil+, a single field name or an array of
    #                  field names. Only those fields will be returned.
    #                  (Called :fields in calls to Collection#find.)
    #
    # number_to_skip :: Number of records to skip before returning
    #                   records. Default is 0.
    #
    # number_to_return :: Max number of records to return. (Called :limit
    #                     in calls to Collection#find.) Default is 0 (all
    #                     records).
    #
    # order_by :: If not +nil+, specifies record sort order. May be a
    #             String, Hash, OrderedHash, or Array. If a string, the
    #             results will be ordered by that field in ascending
    #             order. If an array, it should be an array of field names
    #             which will all be sorted in ascending order. If a hash,
    #             it may be either a regular Hash or an OrderedHash. The
    #             keys should be field names, and the values should be 1
    #             (ascending) or -1 (descending). Note that if it is a
    #             regular Hash then sorting by more than one field
    #             probably will not be what you intend because key order
    #             is not preserved. (order_by is called :sort in calls to
    #             Collection#find.)
    #
    # hint :: If not +nil+, specifies query hint fields. Must be either
    #                +nil+ or a hash (preferably an OrderedHash). See
    #                Collection#hint.
